	"article-content" : {
		"intro": "Peruvians were choosing between two conservative candidates in a tight presidential election on Sunday that has become a referendum on the legacy of imprisoned ex-President Alberto Fujimori’s iron-handed rule in the 1990s.",
		"p1": "Recent polls showed former World Bank economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski having erased the lead held by his better-organized and politically sharper opponent, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of Peru’s former strongman.",
		"p2": "A mock voting exercise Saturday by Lima-based Gfk put support for Kuczynski at 51 percent compared with 49 percent for Fujimori. With a margin for error in the survey of plus or minus 1.6 percentage points, it was still a statistical tie but a far better standing for Kuczynski than a week ago, when he was trailing by more than 4 points. Fujimori topped him in the first round of voting by almost 20 points.",
		"p3": "A potential swing vote in a close race could be the 885,000 Peruvians eligible to vote abroad — about 3.8 percent of the electorate.",
		"p4": "The reference wasn’t just to her father’s well-known ties to corruption, organized crime and death squads, for which he’s serving a 25-year jail sentence, but an attempt to draw attention to a string of scandals that have hobbled Fujimori in the final stretch, most notably a report that one of her big fundraisers and the secretary general of her party is the target of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigation. Peru is the world’s largest producer of cocaine.",
		"p5": "PPK, as Kuczynski is almost universally known in Peru, is also benefiting from a last-minute endorsement by the third-place finisher in the first round of voting, leftist congresswoman Veronika Mendoza, the protagonist of a massive anti-Fujimori demonstration this week the likes of which Peru hasn’t seen since the turbulent end of Fujimori’s rule 16 years ago."
